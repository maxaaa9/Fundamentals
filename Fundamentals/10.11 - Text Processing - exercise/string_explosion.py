# Write a program that reads a string from the console that contains:
# Explosions marked with '>'
# Immediately after the mark, there will be an integer x, which signifies the strength of the explosion
# Any other characters

#   If you find another explosion mark ('>') while deleting characters,
#       you should add the strength to your previous explosion. You should not delete the explosion character â€“ '>'.
# When all characters are processed, print the final string.
