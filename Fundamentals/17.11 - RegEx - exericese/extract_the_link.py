# Write a program that extracts links from a given text.
# The text will come in the form of strings, each representing a sentence.
# You need to extract only the valid links from it. Example:
# The Sub-Domain must always be "www".
# The Domain name can consist of English alphabet letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and dashes ("â€“").
# The Domain extension consists of one or more domain blocks,
# a domain block consists of a dot followed by one or more lowercase English alphabet letters,
# a Domain extension must have at least one domain block in order to be valid. The Sub-Domain and Domain name
#   must be separated by a single dot.
# Any link that does NOT follow the specified above rules should be treated as invalid.
